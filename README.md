# Adding a New Ball Skin
The plugin uses the official Minecraft API, so you need to use official Minecraft heads. For example, you can use a site like Minecraft-Heads. In the "url" field, you need to insert the set of characters at the end of the link. For example, for the link:
http://textures.minecraft.net/texture/93c2f1c5d2c8f0e33730c14dca1c1d1e1abd8596b0839d6738d18f46432b6fa6,
in the "url" field, insert:
93c2f1c5d2c8f0e33730c14dca1c1d1e1abd8596b0839d6738d18f46432b6fa6.

You can also set a permission requirement for using a specific ball skin. To do this, use the optional parameters perm and lock_msg. In perm, specify any permission, and in lock_msg, write the message that will be displayed if a player does not have access to this skin.
